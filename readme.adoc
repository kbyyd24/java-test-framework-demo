= Demo for Test Frameworks

This repo shows demos of test Frameworks in Java. Include `JUnit5`, `Spock`, `Spek` and `Kotest`.

The demo shows unit tests and Spring integration tests.

== For Spock Spring Integration Test

The `MarsRoverSpockTest` is ignored. This is because the `io.kotest.extensions:kotest-extensions-spring` dependency leads NPE when run the test. This library is required by JUnit and Kotest for using `@MockkBean` annotation.

There is an issue https://github.com/Ninja-Squad/springmockk/issues/67[here] for details.

If you want to run the test, need to remove the dependency of `io.kotest.extensions:kotest-extensions-spring` and `@Ignore` annotation. And also remove `MarsRoverServiceJUnitTest` and `MarsRoverServiceKotestTest`, because they depend on the library.
